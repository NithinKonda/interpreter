# Interpreter

## Overview

This project is a simple interpreter for a programming language called **Monkey**, built using Go. The interpreter includes essential components such as a lexer, tokenizer, parser, and a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive use.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Breaks input source code into tokens for further processing.
- **Tokenizer**: Converts the raw source code into a structured format of tokens.
- **Parser**: Analyzes the token stream and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **REPL**: Allows users to interact with the interpreter in real-time.
